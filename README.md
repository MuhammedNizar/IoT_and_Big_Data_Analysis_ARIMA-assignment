#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
This project uses the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics 
to develop a smart home model that dynamically maintains its internal temperature. By 
including sensors to assess ambient temperature and relative humidity, our system 
computes the Heat Index (HI), a fundamental measure of comfort that combines 
temperature and humidity levels to reflect how the conditions feel to the human body.
